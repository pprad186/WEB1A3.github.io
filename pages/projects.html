            <h2 class="artifact-heading"> ePortfolio Website (This Site)</h2>

            <p>
                This website represents my growth as both a student and a developer.  
                It brings together the technical knowledge I've gained—HTML, CSS,
                responsive layouts, file organization, and accessibility—and combines
                them with my personal story as an international student from Kathmandu.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a lot of time refining the structure, improving the navigation,
                and experimenting with the pink-and-beige visual theme until it felt
                warm, soft, and reflective of my personality. Although I made several
                mistakes along the way—misplaced files and, uneven spacing; I learned 
                to troubleshoot methodically and rebuild sections until everything felt clean and consistent.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                This artefact taught me how important it is to test layouts on
                different screen sizes and to use CSS grid/flex in intentional ways.
                It also showed me that design decisions matter just as much as code.
                I'm proud of how this site evolved from a simple template into a
                polished and personal ePortfolio.

                <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                For this multi-page web development project, I was asked to 
                design and build a complete and responsive website using HTML and 
                external CSS. This required me to plan a clear folder structure, 
                create consistent navigation, apply a unified visual theme, and 
                ensure that each page showcased my skills as a designer and developer. 
                I also needed to incorporate multimedia elements, accessibility 
                features, and thoughtful written reflections to demonstrate my 
                understanding of web standards and user-centered design.
                </p>
                <p>
                Working on this project required me to think carefully about how
                different components fit together. I frequently found myself
                reorganizing code that became messy. Over time, I learned to structure
                my stylesheets more cleanly and to write HTML that is readable and
                meaningful. 
                I also made mistakes with responsive layouts—some elements overlapped 
                or resized poorly on smaller screens. By adjusting my CSS, testing 
                frequently, and learning how to apply flexible units and media queries, 
                I was able to resolve these issues and create pages that adapted 
                smoothly across devices. I also refined my visual styling many times, 
                learning the importance of spacing, typography, and consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                Completing this project helped me grow technically and personally. 
                I became far more confident in building structured, multi-page 
                websites and in writing CSS that is organized, maintainable, and 
                responsive. I also developed a stronger eye for design and a deeper 
                appreciation for accessibility and user experience. Most importantly, 
                this project showed me that mistakes are a natural part of the 
                learning process; every challenge pushed me to think more carefully, 
                test more thoroughly, and improve the quality of my work. I feel 
                proud of the final result and the growth that came from creating it.

            <h2 class="artifact-heading"> Web Assignment 2</h2>
            <p>Here is a screenshot of the Home page of a prior project I did along with my partner.</p>
                <figure class="artifact-image-frame">

                </figure>
                <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> For this project, my partner and 
                    I were tasked with building a functional e-commerce website 
                    using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Together, we implemented 
                    a complete storefront experience with product browsing, 
                    filtering, single-item pages, and a working shopping cart. 
                    We shared responsibilities across the codebase, but I was 
                    primarily focused on developing the cart page and the women's/men's 
                    product views, ensuring that items added from different areas of 
                    the site transferred and displayed correctly. I was also focused on the 
                    loading page before the actual website appears. I also spent time 
                    fixing UI alignment and layout issues so the site adapted smoothly 
                    across different screen sizes and devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development process involved a lot of back-and-forth testing, 
                    debugging, and refining features together. One of our earliest 
                    challenges was making dynamic product rendering consistent without 
                    relying on templates, and we encountered issues where styles 
                    shifted or components broke depending on viewport size. I worked 
                    on solving these problems through flexible CSS, responsive 
                    adjustments, and bug-fixing within the product pages and cart 
                    logic. Each mistake taught us something valuable — from handling 
                    filter state more cleanly to improving DOM updates and ensuring the 
                    cart preserved size, color, and quantity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this was a major learning experience in collaboration, 
                    UI structure, and problem-solving. I'm especially proud of how the 
                    cart functionality and gender categories turned out, and I gained 
                    confidence in debugging layout issues across devices. Working as a 
                    team allowed us to build more efficiently, and I left the project 
                    with stronger development skills, a better understanding of 
                    structure and state, and a real appreciation for the process of 
                    breaking, fixing, and improving code.

                <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>
                    This grid layout activity was an important exercise in mastering CSS Grid concepts. 
                    By building a structured layout with defined rows and columns, I learned how to 
                    effectively use grid containers, grid items, and various grid properties to create 
                    responsive designs. The hands-on experience helped me understand how to position 
                    elements precisely within a grid, control spacing, and adapt layouts for different 
                    screen sizes. I encountered challenges with aligning items and managing grid gaps, 
                    but through trial and error, I developed a stronger grasp of grid behavior and best practices. 
                    Overall, this activity enhanced my ability to create clean, organized web layouts using CSS Grid.
