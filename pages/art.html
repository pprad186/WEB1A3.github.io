            <h2>My Artwork</h2>
            <p>I've enjoyed drawing and painting since I was young.
                These are some of my favorite pieces I've created over the years.
                I have used various mediums including pen, pencil, color pencils, oil crayons, and spray paint.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>I have been drawing and painting since I was five years old, and over the years, 
                it has become a central part of my life.Starting with simple sketches as a child, 
                I gradually explored different styles, techniques, and mediums, pencil and watercolors.
                Drawing helps me relax.This long-standing practice has not only helped me develop my 
                artistic skills but has also taught me patience, attention to detail, and 
                the value of creative expression. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I find that the problem-solving mindset I use in programming often inspires 
                new artistic approaches, and conversely, my artistic thinking allows me to think more 
                creatively about technical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I primarily use traditional mediums, I am interested in exploring digital art in the future.
                I hope to combining my passion for art with my computer science background, 
                perhaps exploring digital illustration, animation, or interactive media. I aim to 
                develop projects that blend technology and creativity, allowing me to grow both as 
                an artist and as a technologist.
            </p>
